# Description 

For design assignment number one, we were tasked with putting our own personal style on a single button application. I live by motivitaional quotes so I decided to make an app called instant inspo that gives you a new inspirational quote everytime you tapped on the iPhone screen. I am also really into the asthetics of particle emitters. My goal was to incorperate SKParticleEmitters into this application however I ran into some compatiblility problems with SwiftUI and SprikeKit. 

I built the instant inspo application from the codekit and also designed some particle emitters in a seprate applicaiton just to get familar with SprikeKit
